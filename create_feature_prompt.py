Please create a detailed feature implementation prompt by:

1. Reading the FEATURE_PROMPT_template.md file
2. Gathering information about the requested feature:
   - Feature name and description
   - User story and acceptance criteria
   - Technical requirements
   - Affected components

3. Analyzing the current codebase to determine:
   - Existing patterns to follow
   - Files that need modification
   - New files to create
   - Dependencies to add
   - Testing approach

4. Filling in ALL template placeholders with specific details
5. Creating a step-by-step implementation plan
6. Saving the result as feature_[feature_name].md

Ask the user for:
- Feature name and description
- Priority and complexity
- Specific requirements
- Any constraints or considerations

Make sure to:
- Reference specific files and patterns from the codebase
- Include detailed technical specifications
- Provide clear acceptance criteria
- Define testing requirements
- Consider security and performance implications

The goal is a prompt that another AI can use to implement the feature correctly.
