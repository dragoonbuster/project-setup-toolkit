Please analyze the current project directory and create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file by:

1. Reading the CLAUDE_template.md file
2. Analyzing the project structure, files, and code patterns
3. Detecting:
   - Project name and purpose
   - Technology stack and frameworks
   - File naming conventions
   - Code style patterns
   - Essential commands from package.json/Makefile/etc
   - Testing framework
   - Build/deployment setup
   - Git workflow patterns

4. Filling in ALL template placeholders with project-specific values
5. Saving the result as CLAUDE.md in the project root

Make sure to:
- Be specific rather than generic
- Detect actual patterns from the codebase
- Include all detected commands and scripts
- Set up comprehensive guidelines for future development
- Preserve the template structure while customizing content

The goal is a CLAUDE.md that helps AI assistants understand and work with this specific project effectively.
