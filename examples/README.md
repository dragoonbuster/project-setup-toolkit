# Examples Directory

This directory contains sample outputs generated by the project-setup-toolkit tools.

## Sample Outputs

### Generated Files
- `sample-CLAUDE.md` - Example CLAUDE.md for a React project
- `sample-README.md` - Example README.md for a Python CLI tool
- `sample-.gitignore` - Example .gitignore for a Node.js project
- `sample-feature-prompt.md` - Example feature implementation prompt
- `sample-commit-message.txt` - Example semantic commit message

### How These Were Created
Each sample was generated by:
1. Running the appropriate tool (e.g., `tools/setup_readme.py`)
2. Following the Claude instructions provided
3. Filling the template with realistic project data
4. Saving the result as an example

### Using These Examples
- Review these to understand expected output quality
- Use as reference when creating your own project files
- Copy and modify for similar project types
- Learn the template structure and placeholders
